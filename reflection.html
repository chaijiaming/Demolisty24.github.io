						<h2 class="Section-Heading">The Course</h2>
						<p class="Response">	Through English 202C, I have learned various factors that contributes to writing an appropriate and effective technical communication document. There must be a great deal of consideration for the audience and their background and understand of the topic that I am writing. I have also learned that technical writing doesnâ€™t just come in one form, but various different form such as an instruction set, guide, and even a website. In a professional world, anything that is written to someone particular in a formal way should be written with the consideration of their background, environment, and with a focus on the audience. </p>

						<h2 class="Section-Heading">The Career</h2>
						<p class="Response">With the concept that I have learned from the class, I believe I have develop the capabilities to not only properly communicate with my fellow employee and employer but also to the client as well. In my career, teamwork and proper communicate is essential to a functional work environment and I believe that through this class I have learned to concepts and ideas to do so. As an aspiring software developer, I believe it is my goal as a developer to consider my clients while developing a software. Besides, the usability of the concepts that I have learned from this class in my career, I believe that these concepts are also very appropriate in my research team and my future classes which requires teamwork and proper communication. </p>

					<article id="Projects">
						<h2 class="Section-Heading">The Projects</h2>
						<p  class="Response">In this portfolio, I have decided to include 4 personal programming projects and 4 example of assignment I have done in the class. These projects and assignments that I have decided to include in this portfolio is based on what I believe would be the most relevant to my career and reveals my technical communication skills. By choosing these projects and displaying it on the portfolio, visitor/employer would not only be able to see what I am capable of and what I have created, but also my skill as a technical writer. Being able to describe what my projects does also shows my ability as a technical writer to inform the audience what the project is. I also hope that through the assignment I have decided to showcase, I can not only show my skills but also my interests in my field. I will attempt to highlight my most significant project by showing them first and describing the importance of the project.</p>

					<Article id="Portfolio">
						<h2 class="Section-Heading">The Portfolio</h2>
						<p  class="Response">In this portfolio, I placed the focus of readability and ease of navigation as the core of the website. I believe that a portfolio with a very smooth navigation and readability is very important to a reader who might not know how to start. Also, I have attempt to condense each page of the portfolio to make each page too clustered to greatly improve readability. The navigation bar is fixed at the top to allow for full viewing experience if the page is long and requires scrolling. In each page, I have attempted to navigation the reader to another page in the text as they are reading to allow for a smooth navigation of the website. I have also considered to reduce the amount of technical jargon that is used in this site to allow for various visitors/readers to have a easier time reading the description behind my projects.</p>
